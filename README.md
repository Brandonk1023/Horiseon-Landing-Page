# Horiseon-Landing-Page

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to increase the accessibility of the website for the marketing agency.  By doing this it would ensure that users accessing with assistive technologies would be able to access the content of the site more efficiently.  These changes would also allow for better positioning of the site as a whole in search engines; increasing search engine optimization.  By refactoring the code I was able to solve these issues, while also fixing the broken link in the navigation bar.  This project allowed for further honing of my skills in refactoring, and semantic HTML.
